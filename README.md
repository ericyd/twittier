## Quick start

1. Download executable from [the releases page](https://github.com/ericyd/twitter/releases)
2. Initialize your credentials file: `tw init`
    * If you are on Mac, your computer will try to keep you safe by saying the program is malwaare. After it prompts you to move it to the trash, click "cancel" and immediately open System Preferences > Security & Privacy. Click the button that says "Allow" next to the program name to allow your computer to run it.
3. [Create a developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api). Then create an app. Then grant it write permissions. Then generate an access token and secret. (This is a [better guide than I would write](https://dev.to/sumedhpatkar/beginners-guide-how-to-apply-for-a-twitter-developer-account-1kh7))
4. Copy/paste your API key, API secret, Access token, and Access token secret into your `~/.twitter_credentials.toml` file
5. See what's new: `tw feed`
6. Add to the conversation `tw post "new phone who dis"`

Or as shell commands:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/ericyd/twittier/releases/download/1.0.0/twittier-1.0.0-linux.zip > twittier-1.0.0-linux.zip
unzip twittier-1.0.0-linux.zip
ln -s "$(pwd)/twittier-1.0.0-linux/tw" /usr/local/bin/tw
tw init
vi ~/.twitter_credentials.toml
# insert credentials ^
tw feed
```

## API

### `init`

Initializes the credentials file. Generally you want to run this first and then [create a Twitter developer account](https://dev.to/sumedhpatkar/beginners-guide-how-to-apply-for-a-twitter-developer-account-1kh7) and populate the credentials

Arguments
* `-c`, `--credentials` (Optional)

Examples

```bash
# Defaults to ~/.twitter_credentials.toml
tw init
# Custom file
tw init -c ~/my-custom-credentials-file
```

### `post`

Alerts the world that you are still alive.

Aliases
* `tweet`
* `p`

Arguments
* `message` (Required)
* `replies` (Optional)
* `-p`, `--profile` (Optional). Allows you to specify an alt account to use

Examples
```bash
tw post "I might have poor grammar but so are you"
tw tweet "Calamine lotion tastes funny"
tw p 'Who took the cookies from the cookie jar? Twas me, bitches'
```

#### Posting a thread

Twittier has first-class threading support. Simply include multiple messages when calling `tw post` and it will automatically thread!

Examples
```bash
tw post "i have OPINIONS" "you will LISTEN TO ME" "if you don't there will be DIRE CONSEQUENCES"
```

#### Posting a multi-line tweet

Sometimes you want some whitespace in your thread, like extra lines and stuff. Well too bad, asshole! It isn't supported yet.

#### Using an alt profile

If you want to use with multiple profiles, you'll need to set up your credentials file as follows

```toml
[default]
api_key = ""
api_key_secret = ""
access_token = ""
access_token_secret = ""

[alt1]
api_key = ""
api_key_secret = ""
access_token = ""
access_token_secret = ""
```

Running commands without a `-p` or `--profile` argument will use the `default` credentials, whereas specifying a profile will use those credentials. For example

```bash
tw post "can confirm: @ericydauenhauer is def a human" --profile alt1
```

### `delete`

Delete a prior lapse in judgment

Arguments
* `id` (Required)

Examples
```bash
tw delete 123456
```

### `like`

Like a tweet

Arguments
* `tweet_id` (Required)

Examples
```bash
tw like 123456
```

### `unlike`

Unlike a tweet

Arguments
* `tweet_id` (Required)

Examples
```bash
tw unlike 123456
```

### `home`

Read your recently posted tweets (good for the ego)

Arguments
* `count` (Optional)
    * Must be between 5 and 100

Examples
```bash
tw home
tw home 42
```

### `me`

Get some info about yourself

Examples
```bash
tw me
```

### `feed`

See what people are saying about you

Arguments
* `count` (Optional)

Examples
```bash
# Defaults to 10 or something
tw feed
# Get an exact number (less than 100 plz)
tw feed 42
```

### `version`

Print useful information that you will need when you're filing bug reports for this software

Examples
```bash
tw -v
tw version
tw --version
```

### `help`

Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi; you're my only hope.

Examples
```bash
tw -h
tw help
tw --help
```
### Global arguments

* `--debug`: Prints a bunch of extra info
* `help`, `--help`, `-h`: Include with another argument to get specific help message for that command.
* `-c`, `--credentials`: If you prefer for some bizarre reason to customize the location of your credentials file, you'll have to specify this flag every time

```bash
tw post "fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck donald trump" --debug
tw post -h
tw feed --help
tw init help
tw init -c /path/to/custom/file.toml
```

## Building from source

1. Install [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
2. Set nightly toolchain (required for the `strip` feature)

```bash
rustup default +nightly
```

3. Clone and build

```bash
# Clone repo as needed
git clone https://github.com/ericyd/twittier && cd twittier

# Build
cargo build --release
# or, if you don't use nightly as your default toolchain
cargo +nightly build --release
# Or, if cargo wasn't installed with Rustup, invoke directly
rustup run nightly cargo build --release

# create link
ln -s "$(pwd)/target/release/tw" /usr/local/bin/tw

# Use it
tw -h
```

## Releasing

Turns out cross-compiling is quite hard locally so just use GitHub Actions - its free!

Oh but be sure to [bump the version first](./Cargo.toml)

```bash
# cut tag
git tag 1.0.0 -s
# you're done, GH Actions does the rest üôå
git push --tags
```

## Troubleshooting

### I am getting authentication errors

Be sure to generate an access token and secret after you update your app to have Read & Write permissions. The default is Read-only which will not work.
